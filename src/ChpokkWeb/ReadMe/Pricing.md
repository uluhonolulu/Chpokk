Chpokk has a very simple and convenient pricing policy -- a single payment plan. 
You can call it Starter, Pro, or Enterprise -- it still fits the needs of every coder (and if it doesn't fit yours, [please tell me about it](https://chpokk.uservoice.com/forums/176999-general)).

For [$18/month](https://sites.fastspring.com/geeksoft/instant/chpokkstarter), you're getting every feature that Chpokk currently has -- an online code editor with Intellisense and syntax check for C# and VB.Net, compilation, execution, automated testing, NuGet support, and many other useful things.
Use it for building your project from scratch or take an existing solution, then publish it to Azure or AppHarbor, or just run online.
