
Hi,

I'm Artem Smirnov, the guy behind Chpokk.

I have noticed that you tried to use Chpokk recently, but was denied access. Sorry if it's been a little bit rude to redirect you to the payment screen -- I'm working on this. 

The truth is, I'm making Chpokk a paid service, so that I could dedicate all my time for it, and make it truly awesome.

If you still want to use it, we could make a deal. How about in return for a free month, you answer 3 simple questions? And, if it goes OK, I could arrange a free lifetime account for you in return to some feedback now and then.

So, here are these 3 questions:

1. What is your main reason for using Chpokk? In other words, why you are even interested in a tool like this?

2. If you were to recommend it to another person, what would you say? (If you don't want to recommend it to anybody, it's OK, just tell me)

3. What is a single important thing that you want to be added/improved? Meaning a feature that you need, or a bug you want to be fixed, or something that you want to be removed..

Please answer them just replying to the message, and you're getting a free month (guaranteed), and maybe free lifetime (let's discuss) Chpokk service.

Thanks!
Artem
