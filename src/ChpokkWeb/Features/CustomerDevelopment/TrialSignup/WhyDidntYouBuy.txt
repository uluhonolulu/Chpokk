
Hi,

I'm Artem Smirnov, the guy behind Chpokk.

I have noticed that you clicked the button that must have sent you to the "purchase" page, but you decided not to subscribe to Chpokk.

If you're still interested in my service, I can give you a free month in return of your feedback. I won't mention your name, nor cite your words anywhere. I only need an answer to one simple question.

Why didn't you subscribe?

Is the price of $18 too high for you? Maybe you are happy with the free alternatives? Or the service does not deserve your money (is too buggy/ doesn't have the features you need etc)? Or maybe you're not going to pay for a service like this (why?)?

Please don't hesitate to make me feel uncomfortable. If Chpokk needs improvement, I need to know it, so I that could make it better and help others.

If you have something to say, just reply to this message. I'm handling it manually, so please give me a few hours (depending on your timezone) to give you a free access for the next month. And later we could strike a deal for giving you a forever free access.

Artem
